== Game Tasks ==
 * Game Objects apart from Characters, e.g. swords on the ground or world stuff like benches or trees
    * generiere RPCLASSNAME aus dem eigentlichen Klassennamen..?
 * Inventory to pickup takeable items
 * NPCs to speak to
 * Fighting system, Mobs to kill


== Marauroa Tasks ==
 * World.add(), RPZone.add(), what to use when and where..? Stendhal doesn't seem to use any of that methods in world.
    =>  ask in irc channel about it, point out comment in line 224 seems plain wrong, but something that actually
        should be done.

 * synchronized get() etc., does it need to be synchronized? does it need to be loaded lazily?
  * elementarymud.RPRuleProcessor in public static IRPRuleProcessor get()
  * elementarymud.World in public static World get()

 * World.onInit() vs. World.initialize()

 * several method parameters in RPRuleProcessor can have better names than object, e.g. caster or character
    => Do the fixes, push them to a cloned repository on gitorious and then request the merge manually as a ticket
